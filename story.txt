A man was just finishing a drink at hi local Ratskeller.
It was a nice Summer day, so they had the Biergarten open.
He was enjoying a good pint of Fruh Bock when he decided to order a bratwurst.
He saw Mehlhase driving by in her Audi.
He always  goes to the baeckerei after drinks at the ratskeller.
So he decided to head to one while blasting some Rammstein.
He drove down the Hauptstrasse of Berlin.
It probably would have been more productive to go to the flughafen and fly there. 
He was wearing a dirndel with a lederhose the whole time
while rocking out to his garbage musik and eating his gebaecks.
Along the way he found a hund and the hund tagged along with him on his ling ride
On his way there, his klimaanlage malfunctioned.
